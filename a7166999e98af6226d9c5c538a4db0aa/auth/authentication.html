<p>These API keys have been generated for your API project.  These keys are randomly generated. You can change them by setting the value in your configuration file in the <em>conf</em> directory of your project. However, make sure that you do not share this key with other projects and if you modify them, make sure that they are sufficiently unique. These keys must only be used by this project and not shared with other projects.</p>

</blockquote><p>You authenticate to the API by providing the required API key in the request.</p>
<p>This API is using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP Basic Auth</a> for authentication. Provide the API key as the basic auth username. You do not need to provide a password (it should be an empty string value).</p>
<aside class="warning">The API keys carry privileges, so be sure to keep them secret!</aside>
