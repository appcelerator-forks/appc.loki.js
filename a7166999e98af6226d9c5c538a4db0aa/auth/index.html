<h1 id="heading-introduction"><a name="heading-introduction">Introduction</a></h1><p>This API is organized around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>. This API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and we support cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with your API from a client-side application (though you should remember that you should never expose your secret API key in any public websiteâ€™s client code).</p>
<aside class="success">This API is running in development mode. When you are ready, you can publish your application to production using the console command `appc publish`.</aside>
